## Introduction:

The Library has a wide variety of books where students can go to consult the information needed for their respective academic activities, but knowing that students have little time to visit the library and recess, they need to make a reservation to conclude their respective research.
The development of the School Library System allows for the improvement of the current book reservation and search processes. Students will be able to log in using their institutional mail and password, validating the user data with the API of the IGNUG provided by the Yavirac Higher Technological Institute to access the system and through a friendly interface it will be possible to select the book that you wish to reserve, which will be able to visualize its information and status, whether it is reserved or not and the number of copies that exist of the book.
The system can be used in both mobile and web devices, programmed with React and React Native, using a relational Postgres database.

## Details:

The School Library System will allow the student to make a book reservation, entering the system and visualizing all the content of available books, selecting the one they wish to reserve, the Librarian will approve or reject the reservation request made by the users, he will also have the possibility of adding new books if necessary.
